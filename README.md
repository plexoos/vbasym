When protons accelerated by RHIC collide at &radic;s = 500 GeV the Z and
W bosons can be produced at STAR. In this analysis we measure the asymmetry of
the W (and Z) bosons produced in pp collisions with the spin of the protons
perpendicular to the beam.  During the 2011 run STAR has collected such data for
the first time. The bosons cannot be detected directly but their kinematics can
be reconstructed by detecting the decay products. The Z bosons can be easily
reconstructed in the di-electron channel.  However, the reconstruction of the
W's decaying into a electron-neutrino pair is challenging due to the neutrino
completely escaping the detector. The W has never been reconstructed with the
STAR detector. This analysis is the first attempt to reconstruct the kinematics
of the W bosons at STAR.
